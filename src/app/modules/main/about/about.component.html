                  Three weeks after the launch of the software, the very first customer registers and begins tracking time with 
                  DeskTime. Time tracking is still the core feature of the app: in 6 years, DeskTime has tracked over 63 million

                    DeskTime goes online on July 1st, 2011 under the wings of the Draugiem Group, the Latvia based IT company. The main
                     idea of the time tracking software, from day one, is to increase workplace transparency between employees and management
                      and to make sure work time is spent faithfully.
